# Claude Project Research & Management Prompt
## 11Labs Voice Agent Integration with BookingSearchMCP + CorePaymentMCP

### Project Brief

You are tasked with researching and managing the integration of 11Labs voice agents with our dual-MCP booking automation system. This system enables end-to-end voice booking workflows from initial customer inquiry through automated payment processing and calendar management.

### System Overview

We have built a complete voice booking automation system consisting of two main components:

1. **BookingSearchMCP** - Handles booking availability search and validation
2. **CorePaymentMCP** - Manages payment processing and automation workflows

The 11Labs voice agent needs to integrate with BookingSearchMCP via MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools to enable natural voice booking conversations.

### Current System Status

#### BookingSearchMCP (PRODUCTION READY)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/zaphod-black/BookingSearchMCP
- **Status**: ✅ Fully operational with Google Calendar integration
- **MCP Tools**: 3 tools implemented and tested
- **Performance**: Voice-optimized responses (<200 chars, <100ms target)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with real Google Calendar data

#### CorePaymentMCP (PRODUCTION READY)  
- **Status**: ✅ Fully operational payment automation system
- **Features**: Stripe payment links, Gmail automation, Google Calendar events
- **Workflows**: Complete success/timeout customer service automation
- **Integration**: HTTP webhook endpoint for BookingSearchMCP handoff

### Research Objectives

#### Primary Objective
Research and document the specific technical requirements, configuration steps, and integration patterns needed to connect 11Labs voice agents with our MCP-based booking system.

#### Secondary Objectives
1. Identify 11Labs MCP protocol support and configuration requirements
2. Document conversation flow patterns for optimal voice booking experiences
3. Research error handling and fallback mechanisms for voice interactions
4. Investigate performance optimization strategies for real-time voice calls
5. Document testing and validation procedures for voice agent integration
